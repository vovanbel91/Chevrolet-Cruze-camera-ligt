# Chevrolet-Cruze-camera-ligt

Illumination module with a camera hatch for Chevrolet Cruze, Lachetti, Aveo, Opel Astra, and many GM cars.

One day, I was asked to implement a project for a rearview camera hatch in a Chevrolet car since it completely solves the problem of protecting the rearview camera from rain and dirt.
For the reference model, I used the factory-installed illumination module. The model is designed in such a way that with all the installed elements, it fits perfectly into the stock mount.

The code is very simple. To control the servo motor more smoothly, I used the AlexGyver library.
The connection diagram is attached.

To implement this, you will need to find the following signal wires:
1.	+12V that activates with ignition.
2.	+12V that activates in reverse drive mode.
3.	Car number plate light power.
   
For assembly, you will need two M2x10 screws with M2 nuts and a washer.

For the illumination, you can use any LEDs. I used two LEDs with 3.2V, 1A, and a 9-ohm resistor.

Attention! In your country, laws regarding vehicle lighting devices may prohibit the installation of such a module.

You can find all the models on the Thingiverse website:
